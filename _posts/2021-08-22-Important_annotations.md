In this post I will write everything that I feel is important or that I will need in the future

## Chapter 2

- Random seed -> computers don't really know how to creat random numbers but they simply know how to creat lists of numbers that look random so we provide the same starting point each time - called *seed* so that we get the exact same list each time.
- Images don't go one by one to the model but rather in groups called *mini-batch* which are then grouped into a big array called *tensor* (fastai will make tensor 64 bytes by default).
- It is best to train a simple and fast model, and then deal with image label errors, then to build a complex and time consuming one.
- When exporting a model to use in a online application we need to extract the architecture as well as the trained parametres.
- Consider reading -> [*Building Machine Learning Powered Applications by Emmanuel Ameisen*](https://www.amazon.com/Building-Machine-Learning-Powered-Applications/dp/149204511X).

## Chapter 3

-This chapter was super intriguing and very complicated and because the topic was more about personal thinking there isn't much of annotations.
-Authors please change the line about *Technology is power* at page 115 to the Spider-Man uncle Ben Quote.
-Check out -> [*An Ethical Toolkit for Engineering/Design Pratice*](https://oreil.ly/vDGGC).
